I designed the entire UI/UX by myself, including a beautiful typewriter effect on the login page, and a simple and beautiful card design after entering the Dashboard. Especially when editing questions, you will find that there are many logics that can go wrong (single-choice questions but choose Multiple options, multiple choice questions but only one option is selected, etc.), and Play Game, due to the checkbox limitation caused by the question type, I have made the UI/UX more intuitive and easy to use by using state and button variants
